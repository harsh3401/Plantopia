        Plantopia - A Vegetation Cover Monitoring Application
      </h1>
      <p class="font-medium text-emerald-700 pb-3">
        Plantopia is a project build to estimate, monitor and analyze change in
        vegetation cover using GIS techniques. Vegetation cover defines the
        percentage of soil which is covered by green vegetation. In a wide range
        of environments, vegetation cover greatly affects both surface water
        runoff and sediment loss. A vegetation cover of 45-50% is considered a
        critical value since above this value soils are adequately protected
        from raindrop impact and soil erosion is significantly reduced. This
        project aims at the monitoring of the changing land cover and thus
        creating awareness regarding it.
