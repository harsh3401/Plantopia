## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Vegetation cover defines the percentage of soil which is covered by trees and plants. Vegetation cover plays very important role on protecting the soil surface from raindrop splashing, increasing soil organic matter, soil aggregate stability, water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, retarding and reducing surface water runoff, etc. In a wide range of environments, both water run-off and soil sediment loss decrease exponentially as the percentage of vegetation cover increases. (Elwell and Stocking, 1976; Lee and Skogerboe 1985, Francis and Thornes 1990). 
A vegetation cover of 45-50% is considered a critical value since above this value soils are adequately protected from raindrop impact and soil erosion is significantly reduced. This threshold may be modified for different types of vegetation, rain intensity and land attributes. In the case of poor plant cover, the erosion processes may be very active and the regeneration of natural vegetation may be irreversible. Vegetation cover can be measured in the field by assessing the percentage of the ground that it is covered by the existing annual or perennial vegetation. Aerial photographs or satellite images can also be used for measuring vegetation cover of extensive areas.
Vegetation cover is key factor on land degradation. Reduction in the perennial cover is regarded as an important indicator of the onset of desertification. Soil erosion and degradation begins only when a substantial portion of the land's surface is denuded of vegetation, then it proceeds with an accelerated mode, that cannot be arrested by land resistance alone. Vegetation cover increases with increasing soil depth and thus decreasing longevity of drought. In the soil depth class of 15-30 cm, the vegetation cover class of 25-50% had the maximum frequency of appearance (93%) in the semi-arid zone, whereas areas with soils having the same soil depth class had a higher vegetation cover with a 64% maximum frequency of appearance of the cover class 75-90% cover in the dry sub-humid zone. 
This project will help in automated monitoring the vegetation cover in a particular area by using GIS techniques, thus giving insights for future planning of land resources. This project discusses the importance of land vegetation cover and its impact on the environment, it also discusses the real-time monitoring of the vegetation cover and its implementation and provides components to generate timelapse GIFs and classify land cover for better assessment of the land cover. We have also implemented change detection features to get an idea of the vegetation change over the years for further analysis.
